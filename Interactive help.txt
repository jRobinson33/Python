In some cases I've simply selected an option for examples

dir() 			: gives a list of directories
dir(__builtins__) 	: gives you the directory for builtins

help(pow) 		: gives help about the power function

to get available modules that you have to import
help('modules')

you can then for example use
import math

after using "import math" in the interactive shell we can
dir(math)

we can then get help for say, radians. But we have to use the path
help(math.radians)
